\title{Annotate proteins}
\usage{
annotateProteins(pdat, annotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdat}{A \code{proteusData} object containing protein data}

\item{annotation}{A data frame with a column \code{protein} containing
protein identifiers, as in \code{pdat$proteins}}
}
\value{
A \code{proteusData} with annotation field added.
}
\description{
\code{annotateProteins} adds protein annotations to a \code{proteusData}
object.
}
\details{
The only information about proteins proteus package extracts from the
evidence file are protein identifiers. These can be in various forms,
depending on how MaxQuant was ran. In order to annotate them, two steps are
required.

First, the user needs to create a data frame linking protein identifiers (as
in \code{pdat$proteins} vector) to some metadata. This data frame has to
contain a column called \code{protein} with the identifiers and any
additional columns with annotations, e.g., UniProt IDs, protein names, gene
names, domains, GO-terms and so on. These data can be obtained from UniProt.
Any annotation columns included will be used by interactive functions
\code{plotFID_live} and \code{plotVolcano_live}.

See \code{\link{fetchFromUniProt}} for obtaining annotation data from
UniProt.

Once the annotation table is created, it can be merged into the
\code{proteusData} object using \code{annotateProteins} function. The order
of identifiers in the annotation table is not important. Also, not all
proteins have to be present. The merge will add only the matching proteins.
As a result, this function returns a \code{proteusData} object with
\code{annotation} field added. It contains an annotation data frame with rows
corresponding to the internal list of proteins. This means the rows of this
data frame correspond one-to-one to the rows in \code{pdat$tab} and
\code{pdat$detect}, if pdat contains proteins (not peptides).
